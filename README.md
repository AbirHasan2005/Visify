## How to use:
- Setup:
Download and install `php` and `git` package.
	- In Termux install via `pkg install php git -y` command.
	- In Kali/Dabian/Ubuntu install via `sudo apt-get install php git -y` command.
	- In Arch Linux install via `sudo pacman install -Sy php git` command.
	- In Windows install PHP and git by searching in Google ;) or install Ubuntu in Windows by typing `bash` command in Command Prompt/PowerShell. It will install Ubuntu in your Windows. But remember to enable ***Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta)*** in **Windows Features** first. Okay watch a video on YouTube for that. It will be better.
